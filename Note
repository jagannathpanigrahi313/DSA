;(semicolumn)  it is a statement terminalator like a Fullstop (.) in sentence

0 OR 1 is a binary number

any one binary number is of 1 bit
        8 bits = 1 byte

variables are containersto store data 
          it can be letter/word But word must not stand from any digit

*  diffrence between float and double
| You write           | Works? | Good Practice? | Why?                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `float a = 3.14;`   | ✅      | ❌              | 3.14 is a `double`, not exact match                                        |
| `float a = 3.14f;`  | ✅      | ✅              | `f` matches float exactly                                                  |
| `double b = 3.14;`  | ✅      | ✅              | `3.14` is already `double`                                                 |
| `double b = 3.14f;` | ✅      | ❌              | You’re giving a float to a double (less precise → more precise, not ideal) |


Q  diffrence between \n and << end l

#include <iostream>             | OUTPUT: hello world 
using namespace std;            |         jaga 
                                |
int main() {                    | if not put \n then output is 
                                |                              hello worldjaga
    cout << "hello world\n";    |
    cout << "jaga"<<endl;       | NOTE: \n we put only between this "  " only
                                |
 return 0;                      |
}                               |
