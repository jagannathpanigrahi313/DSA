;(semicolumn)

0 OR 1 is a binary number

any one binary number is of 1 bit
        8 bits = 1 byte

variables are containersto store data 
          it can be letter/word But word must not stand from any digit

| `float a = 3.14;`   | ✅      | ❌              | 3.14 is a `double`, not exact match                                        |
| `float a = 3.14f;`  | ✅      | ✅              | `f` matches float exactly                                                  |
| `double b = 3.14;`  | ✅      | ✅              | `3.14` is already `double`                                                 |
| `double b = 3.14f;` | ✅      | ❌              | You’re giving a float to a double (less precise → more precise, not ideal) |
